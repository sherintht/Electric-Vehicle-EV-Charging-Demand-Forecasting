# ðŸ”‹ Electric Vehicle Charging Demand Forecasting

This project forecasts the demand at EV charging stations using time-series analysis, enabling better infrastructure planning and energy optimization. It integrates multiple datasets such as EV usage, weather, and traffic data to build predictive models and interactive dashboards.

## ðŸš€ Objective
Forecast EV charging demand based on historical usage patterns, weather conditions, and traffic data, and visualize the trends to support data-driven decision-making.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- **Programming:** Python, Excel  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Prophet, ARIMA, Matplotlib  
- **Visualization:** Tableau (heatmaps, trend lines, dashboards)  
- **Deployment:** Jupyter Notebook (Python scripts), Tableau Public,Streamlit

## ðŸ“ˆ Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Merged datasets: EV usage logs, weather records, and traffic data.
   - Handled missing values and normalized demand figures.

2. **Time-Series Modeling**
   - Implemented forecasting using Prophet and ARIMA.
   - Evaluated model performance using MAPE and RMSE metrics.

3. **Visualization**
   - Created interactive Tableau dashboards to display demand trends by year, time of day, and weather conditions.
   - Developed heatmaps to highlight peak usage periods.

4. **Optimization Strategy**
   - Suggested charging schedule adjustments based on forecasted peaks.
   - Recommended demand-based resource allocation.

## ðŸ“Š Key Outputs
- Forecasting Models (Prophet, ARIMA)
- Tableau Heatmaps and Dashboards
- Charging Optimization Report
